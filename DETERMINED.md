Diving into  the wild ocean of params.

# Determined write-up

> A homenage to the [Determined AI](https://determined.ai/) platform.

The following are chery-picked screenshots of the Determined UI during the experiments of this project.
The descriptions are of both expainatory and insightful nature. Written in colabotratio with [Captain Obvious](https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Captain-Hook.jpg).

<!-- You can save your model and corresponding checkpoints. That's pretty cool! -->

## The Core Api

The core api offers us extended flexibility, on the costs that it is slightly more complicated to set up.

The first view shows the validation loss over epochs.
Here we can see how our model overfits on out dataset.
Obviously it should go down correlating with the training loss.
![overfitting](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25290565/232586881-4487c583-9a78-4292-9d4b-bdc21b577c8f.png)

Arguably the most valuable plot are the hyperparameter plots over validation loss.
The versus plots help us to easily detect the better params. 
Dropout is a special case as a high dropout might need more epochs to proof beneficial.

The hyperparameter search space is my favorite!! I always wanted to play around with these filters on my own model.

The classic confusion matrix. The heatmap makes this the most appealing plot!
Personally is scores second on the added-value scale.
Undoubtfully it will benefit from more runs aka more data-points.
It would be cool to be able to drag-drop them around to change the position of the plots.

## PytorchTiral 

This is the easy-going way which also lets you register your model on the Determined UI.
For this experiment we set `normalization` and the granularity of the labels as searchable hyperparameter.

Again, the beautiful search space, this time with even more hyper-parameters. 
Results show that not normalizing does not hurt the binary classification.

The vs plots, always a win:

The confusion matrix seems to not work for values of different types, such as float and bool.
The author of this repo considers opening a feature request for this.

Finally the model hub. 
Only thing missing here is a hotlink to upload our model to huggingface ü§ó

Thanq you Determined AI team for this flabbergasting platform! ü§çüêßü§ç
